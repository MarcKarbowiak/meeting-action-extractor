# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records for the **meeting-action-extractor** repository.

These ADRs document key technical decisions made during implementation, including trade-offs and future revisit triggers.

Each ADR follows this structure:

- Title
- Status
- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives Considered
- Consequences
- Security Considerations
- Revisit Triggers

The purpose of these ADRs is to:

- Make architectural reasoning explicit
- Demonstrate consulting-grade decision discipline
- Prevent implicit or undocumented trade-offs
- Provide future maintainers with decision context

This repository intentionally keeps ADRs concise and directly tied to real implementation constraints (Local Mode + Azure Mode).
